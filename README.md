## Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of India's electric vehicle (EV) market to support AtliQ Motors' expansion. The analysis covers the years 2022-2024, focusing on identifying sales trends, EV penetration rates, state performance, and competitor analysis in both 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler segments.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Motors, an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles (EVs), has seen its market share rise to 25% in North America’s electric and hybrid vehicle segments over the past five years. As part of their expansion plans, AtliQ Motors intends to launch their bestselling models in India, where their current market share is less than 2%. Bruce Haryali, the Chief of AtliQ Motors India, requested a detailed market study of India’s existing EV/hybrid market. The analysis task was assigned to Peter Pandey, a data analyst on the AtliQ Motors analytics team, to assess the market landscape and provide actionable insights to guide the company’s strategy.

### Task Summary
1. **Primary and Secondary Questions**: The analysis began with a focus on primary and secondary market questions provided by AtliQ Motors, using tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel to answer them.
2. **Dashboard Creation**: A Power BI dashboard was designed to visualize key metrics and insights in a user-friendly format.
3. **Additional Data and Insights**: Supplementary research supported the analysis and enhanced the strategic recommendations.
4. **Engagement and Storytelling**: The project was presented through a concise, engaging video to communicate findings effectively, as per Bruce Haryali’s preference for storytelling.

## Project Objectives

- **Python**: Data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
- **Additional Research**: For supplementary insights and contextual recommendations.

## Dashboard Insights
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and support data-driven decision-making:

- **Market Overview**:
  - Total EV Sales: 1M units in 2024 with a **CAGR** of 93.91%.
  - Revenue Growth: 2022-2024 revenue increased by 324.92%, reaching ₹209.63 billion.
  - Future Potential: Projected sales of 54M EVs by 2030 reflect long-term growth.

- **Segment Analysis**:
  - **2-Wheelers**: Hold 91.48% of the market share, led by OLA Electric with a CAGR of 373.22%.
  - **4-Wheelers**: Despite lower market share, have a higher revenue growth rate (367.79%), dominated by Tata Motors and emerging players like BYD India.

## Key Findings
1. **Maharashtra and Karnataka** exhibit the strongest sales and growth, with penetration rates of 8.60% and 10.18%, respectively.
2. **2-Wheelers** dominate in volume, but 4-Wheelers yield higher CAGR, indicating profitability for newer players.
